"""
For a CSV-file of the following format:

* header column 1 = which kinds of IDs are listed (e.g. 'bibs,holdings')
* header column 2 = which xpath in these records to manipulate
* content column 1 = comma-separated list of IDs for update
* content column 2 = text to write to xpath element

Assume the action is 'PUT' and manipulate the records
with the given IDs in a way, where searching by the xpath
given in heading of column two, values of column to are set
as the elements text (use --append if you do not want to replace
any existing text).

Please note that you will need to provide all ancestors the first column. So
if for example you want to update items, you will need to provide IDs in the
format 'mms-id,holding-id,item-id' and make the header of the column
'bibs,holdings,items'.
